# Document-Scanner-App-using-MATLAB-App-Designer

In this project, our aim was to make a document scanner app using MATLAB App Designer. The main objectives of this project are to have a readable document and to transform the tilted paper images into straight projected images.

## GUI Design

In this GUI design, there are elements such as tab group, axes, buttons, and drop-down menu. The axes elements are used for displaying the original and scanned images. Selecting through the tabs, the user can display and scan up to 10 images. 
The rotate drop-down menu helps to rotate image if needed. It has choices like 90,180,270,0,-90,-180 and -270. 
After the user uploads the files using Upload Images button, the images can be seen in the tabs. Then, by clicking to the Scan button, the user can start the scanning process by selecting the edges of the image. The edges should be selected according to this order: top-left corner, bottom-left corner, bottom-right corner and top-right corner.
After the scanning process is completed, the user can select between the two different filter selections. And by switching through each tab, the filters can be applied to the desired image. Generally, the binarize button shows a great result but if there is a shadowed image or an image that looks un-readable with binarize button, the histogram eq. button can be used.
